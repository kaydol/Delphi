Tetrino is my version of Tetris.
Unfortunately, it's still buggy, especially on fast speed.

Feautures :
* Falling speed increasing with completed lines
* You'll earn more score for completing multiple lines at a time
* Godlike status on 80% of speed and 18000 score [can be adjusted in main module]
* Each time you turn on Pause mode you lose 100 score [to prevent spamming]
* Sound effects for all events

Known issues :
* Falling figure sometimes can go through static blocks [can be noticed on fast speed]
